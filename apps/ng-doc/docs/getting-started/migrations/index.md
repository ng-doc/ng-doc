This page contains information about migrating from previous versions of NgDoc to the current
version.

## Migration to >= v16.8

In v16.8.0, all config APIs were changed instead of exporting a variable, now you need to export
a result of a function call.

For example, if you have the following category config:

```ts
import {NgDocCategory} from '@ng-doc/core';

const category: NgDocCategory = {
  title: 'API Reference',
};

export default category;
```

You need to change it to:

```ts
import {category} from '@ng-doc/core';

export default category({
  title: 'API Reference',
});
```

It affects all configs, including `ng-doc.api.ts`, `ng-doc.category.ts`, `ng-doc.page.ts` and
`ng-doc.config.ts`. It simplifies the configuration and fixes some issues with the previous
implementation, e.g. when the variable name cannot be generated by schematic command from the
`title` if it contains cyrillic characters or any other not supported characters.

To automatically migrate all your configs, you need to run the following command:

```bash
ng g @ng-doc/builder:config-format-migration
```

## Migrating to >= v16.3

In v16.3.0, new standalone pages were introduced. Now you don't need `ng-doc.dependencies.ts` file
or `NgModule` anymore, all dependencies can be imported directly in the `ng-doc.page.ts` file.

To migrate from previous versions, you need to run the following command:

```bash
ng g @ng-doc/builder:standalone-pages-migration
```

This command will remove `ng-doc.dependencies.ts` file and update all `ng-doc.page.ts` files
by importing all dependencies directly.

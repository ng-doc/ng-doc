# {{ NgDocPage.title }}

Keywords allow you not to tie your documentation to certain links, as well as make it more dynamic,
as a result, mentions of certain entities or pages will turn into links automatically.

> **Warning**
> Keywords are case-sensitive and only support PascalCase, so if you want to create a link to
> an entity you must specify the correct case of the entity name.

## API keywords

NgDoc automatically generates keywords for all declarations specified in `ng-doc.api.ts` (
see `*EntitiesAPI` for how to create it), for example, if you have a class declaration that's called
`MyAwesomeClass`, NgDoc generates keyword `MyAwesomeClass` for it, this means that if you decide to
mention this class as inline code or block code, NgDoc will automatically create a link to the API
page of this declaration.

For example here is the block code, that uses one of types from our Ui-Kit.

```typescript
import { NgDocSize } from './size';

const size: NgDocSize = 'small';
```

## Page keywords

You can also use this functionality to create links to other pages, so if you decide to move a page
from one category to another, you don't have to search the documentation for paths that no longer
work.

> **Note**
> To turn a page keyword into a link, use the inline code (should start with `*` symbol)
> in which you specify the keyword

We have added a special prefix `*` to use page keywords to notify you of outdated links. So, to
create keyword for the page, specify your preferred keyword in your page configuration in
the `keyword` field.

```typescript name="ng-doc.page.ts" {8}
import { NgDocPage } from '@ng-doc/core';

const MyAwesomePage: NgDocPage = {
  title: 'My Awesome Page',
  mdFile: './index.md',
  // This keyword can be used to create a link to the page
  // (e.g. like that "*MyCustomKeyword")
  keyword: `MyCustomKeyword`,
};

export default MyAwesomePage;
```

After that, you can use this keyword to create a link to the page.

```markdown name="index.md"
Link to the page: `*MyCustomKeyword`
```

## Global keywords

> **Note**
> You can also load keywords from external sources, you can read about it in the
> `*FeaturesKeywordsLoaders` article.

Sometimes it is necessary to create links to third-party documentation or just to other web-sites,
to create such links you can use global keywords that can be declared in the configuration file,
you can read about it in the `*GettingStartedConfiguration` article.

```typescript name="ng-doc.config.ts"
import { NgDocConfiguration } from '@ng-doc/builder';

const config: NgDocConfiguration = {
  keywords: {
    keywords: {
      google: {
        title: 'Google', // optional, will use the key of the object if not provided
        url: 'https://google.com/',
      },
    },
  },
};

export default config;
```

After that, you can use this keyword to create a link to the page.

```markdown name="index.md"
Link to the page: `google`
```

## Anchors

To make your keywords more accurate, you can use anchors, which are specified after the keyword
separated by a dot or a hash sign to create a link to a specific section of the page or to a
API's member.

> **Note**
> NgDoc uses `githubSlugger` under the hood to generate anchors, so you can read more about it in
> the official documentation. Also, the anchors in keywords are not case-sensitive, so you can use
> any case you want.

```markdown name="index.md"
**Page anchors**

- Link to the section in guides - `*GettingStartedInstallation#Manual`
- Link to the section in guides - `*GettingStartedInstallation#Automatic-Recommended`

**API anchors**

- Link to the "Properties" section in the API - `NgDocBaseInput#Properties`
- Link to the specific property in the API - `NgDocBaseInput.ngControl`
- Link to the specific parameter of the constructor in the
  API - `NgDocInputStringDirective.elementRef`
- Link to the getter in the API - `NgDocBaseInput.get-disabled`
- Link to the setter in the API - `NgDocBaseInput.set-disabled`
- Link to the method in the API - `NgDocBaseInput.focus`
```

**Page anchors**

- Link to the section in guides - `*GettingStartedInstallation#Manual`
- Link to the section in guides - `*GettingStartedInstallation#Automatic-Recommended`

**API anchors**

- Link to the "Properties" section in the API - `NgDocBaseInput#Properties`
- Link to the specific property in the API - `NgDocBaseInput.ngControl`
- Link to the specific parameter of the constructor in the
  API - `NgDocInputStringDirective.elementRef`
- Link to the getter in the API - `NgDocBaseInput.get-disabled`
- Link to the setter in the API - `NgDocBaseInput.set-disabled`
- Link to the method in the API - `NgDocBaseInput.focus`

## Query parameters

You can also use query parameters in your keywords like you would do in a regular URL, for example,
you can create a link to the API List page and specify the query parameter to filter the list.

```markdown name="index.md"
Link to the API List page with query parameter: `*ApiReferences?type=Class`
```

Link to the API List page with query parameter: `*ApiReferences?type=Class`

## Definitions of keywords

There are two types of keywords: **Page** keywords and **API** keywords.

#### Page keyword

- Can be used to create links to other pages (**Guides**).
- Always **start with asterisk** (`*`).
- **Cannot** be used to create links to API pages of internal documentation.
- The keyword used is **mandatory** - if the keyword is unknown, the builder will throw a warning.
- The keyword of the Page and its Anchor are concatenated with a hash (`#`).
- The Anchor **is not** case-sensitive.

#### API keyword

- Can be used to create links to **API pages** of **internal** documentation.
- Has **no prefix**.
- **Cannot be** used to create links to other pages (Guides).
- The keyword is an API **declaration** name.
- The Anchor is a declaration's **member** name.
- The Anchor **is case-sensitive** if it's a member name.
- The Anchor for **getters** and **setters** should be prefixed with `get-` or `set-`.
- The builder **doesn't throw** a warning if the keyword is unknown.
- The builder **does throw** a warning if it knows the keyword, but its Anchor is unknown.
- The Anchor can be used to link section of the API page:
  - The keyword of the API Page and its Anchor are concatenated with a hash (`#`).
  - The Anchor **is not** case-sensitive.

#### Global keyword

- Can be used to create links to **external** documentation.
- Can be defined in the **configuration file**.
- It can be either a **Page** keyword or an **API** keyword.
- It **inherits** the rules of the keyword type it is defined as.

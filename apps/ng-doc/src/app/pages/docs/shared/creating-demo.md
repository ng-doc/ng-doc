## Creating a demo

First of all, in order to display the demo on the page, you need the `ng-doc.dependencies.ts`
file as well as the `NgModule`, you can read about how to create them in the `*EntitiesDependencies`
article.

Please make sure your demo is declared in your page module and registered in
the `ng-doc.dependencies.ts` file
before you continue.

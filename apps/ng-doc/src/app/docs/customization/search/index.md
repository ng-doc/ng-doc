This article describes how to customize the search functionality of the documentation
and how to create a custom search.

## Language

By default, the search is configured to search in English.
If your documentation is in another language, you can change the language of the search.
To do so, you need to provide the preferred language to the `provideSearchEngine` function
in your root module.

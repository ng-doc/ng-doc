This article only scratches the surface of theme creation, we won't dive into the details of all the
variables in it, when its API stabilizes we'll cover other topics in more detail.

## How to create your own theme

Themes in NgDoc are regular CSS files that override CSS variables, in order to create your own theme
you need to create a theme file.

For example, create a `custom-theme.css` file in the `assets/themes` folder of your documentation
project.

> **Note**
> You can also use SASS or LESS, but then you will need to compile it to CSS before running the
> application

> **Note**
> The theme file must be in the `assets` directory so that NgDoc can dynamically load it when
> necessary.

### Registering a theme

Once you have created a theme file, you need to register it, you can do this by passing a list of
your themes to the `forRoot` method of the `NgDocModule` module

Your theme value must match the `NgDocTheme` interface.

```typescript
import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';
import {NgDocModule} from '@ng-doc/app';
import {AppComponent} from './app.component';

@NgModule({
	declarations: [AppComponent],
	imports: [
		NgDocModule.forRoot({
			themes: [
				{
					// Your theme ID that you can use to enable theme
					id: 'custom-theme',
					// Path to the theme, that will be used by NgDoc to load theme
					path: 'assets/themes/custom-theme.css',
				},
			],
		}),
	],
	bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### Theme content

A theme is just a set of overridden CSS variables that NgDoc uses, for example, our `night` theme
looks like this, which allows you to enable dark mode.

```scss
{% include "../../../../../../../libs/app/styles/themes/ng-doc-night.scss" %}
```

## Switching themes

Once you have created your theme, you can use `NgDocThemeService` to apply it to your application.
Just put your theme id to the `set` method.

```typescript
import {NgDocThemeService} from '@ng-doc/app';

@Component({})
export class AppComponent {
	constructor(protected readonly themeService: NgDocThemeService) {}

	setTheme(): void {
		this.themeService.set('custom-theme');
	}
}
```

## Theme by default

If you don't need the functionality to switch themes on the fly and would like to set a default
theme, then you can do this by passing a theme id to the `forRoot` method of the `NgDocModule`
module

```typescript
import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';
import {NgDocModule} from '@ng-doc/app';
import {AppComponent} from './app.component';

@NgModule({
	declarations: [AppComponent],
	imports: [NgDocModule.forRoot({defaultTheme: 'custom-theme'})],
	bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## Themes out of the box

NgDoc comes with following themes out of the box:

- Light theme (default)
- Night theme (`NG_DOC_NIGHT_THEME`)
- Dark Purple theme (`NG_DOC_DARK_PURPLE_THEME`)

The light theme is set by default and has no `id`, while other themes are optional and can be
loaded using the `NgDocThemeService` service, or set by default using the `defaultTheme` field in
the `forRoot` method of the module ` NgDocModule`.

For example, you can set the dark theme by default as follows

```typescript
import {NgModule} from '@angular/core';
import {NgDocModule, NG_DOC_NIGHT_THEME} from '@ng-doc/app';
import {AppComponent} from './app.component';

@NgModule({
	declarations: [AppComponent],
	imports: [NgDocModule.forRoot({defaultTheme: NG_DOC_NIGHT_THEME.id})],
	bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## Code highlighting

We use the `highlightjs` library for code highlighting, it has a lot of ready-made themes, and if
you want to use a different code theme for your NgDoc theme, then you can simply import the code
theme file
from the `highlightjs` library into your theme file.

> **Note**
> To include one CSS file in another, you will need to use SASS or LESS, and the import must be
> relative and not contain an extension, read
> more [here](https://sass-lang.com/blog/feature-watchcss-imports-and-css-compatibility)

For example like this

```scss
// theme.scss

@import '../../../../../node_modules/highlight.js/styles/agate';

:root {
	// My custom theme implementation
}
```

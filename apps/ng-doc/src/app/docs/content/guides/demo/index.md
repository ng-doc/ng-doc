What is documentation without a demo right? Sometimes we all like to look at
the code and usage first, and only then read the documentation. ðŸ˜„

## Creating a demo

First of all, in order to display the demo on the page, you need the `ng-doc.dependencies.ts`
file as well as the `NgModule`, you can read about how to create them in the `*EntitiesDependencies`
article.

If you already have them, you can start creating a demo, the demo in NgDoc is a regular Angular
Component, which shows one of the possible uses of your code.

You can create a `demos` folder which will store all the demos for your page and create an Angular
Component inside it.

### Declaring in NgModule

After that make sure your component is declared in the `declaration` section of
your `NgModule`, and all its dependencies are imported in the `imports` section.

```typescript
{% include "./ng-doc.module.ts" %}
```

### Adding module and demo to dependencies file

And the last step is to add your demo to the `ng-doc.dependencies.ts` file, in the `demos` section,
this is necessary so that NgDoc knows which components it should consider as a demo, and what their
name is, this can be done simply list them separated by commas.

```typescript
{% include "./ng-doc.dependencies.ts" %}
```

### Displaying demo

To display the created demo on the page, you should use the `demo` method from `NgDocActions`,
passing the name of your component to it as follows

```twig
{{'{{ NgDocActions.demo("ButtonDemoComponent") }}' | safe }}
```

#### Output

NgDoc will separate your component's code into multiple tabs to make it easier to view, and show it
like this

{{ NgDocActions.demo("ButtonDemoComponent") }}

## Configuration

The demo action also supports some options that can be passed as the second parameter and must
conform to the `NgDocDemoActionOptions` interface. For example, displaying a demo without a
container.

```twig
{{'{{ NgDocActions.demo("ButtonDemoComponent", {container: false}) }}' | safe }}
```

#### Output

> **Note**
> You can use this option not only as a demo output, but also as an opportunity to insert any of your
> components into the page template so that the user can interact with them.

{{ NgDocActions.demo("ButtonDemoComponent", {container: false}) }}

## Snippets

If you prefer to write template and style code in one `typescript` file, or you just don't want to
create multiple files for one demo, or you want to help users to focus on more important lines of code,
then you should try to use snippets.

> **Note**
> Snippets also work for components with multiple files

Snippets look like comments, we have 3 different types of snippets that you can use

| Language   | Start                                   | End                                   |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| TypeScript | `/* NgDocCodeSnippetStart(Title) */`    | `/* NgDocCodeSnippetEnd(Title) */`    |
| HTML       | `<!-- NgDocHTMLSnippetStart(Title) -->` | `<!-- NgDocHTMLSnippetEnd(Title) -->` |
| Styles     | `/* NgDocStyleSnippetStart(Title) */`   | `/* NgDocStyleSnippetStart(Title) */` |

And let's say if you have a component that contains snippets and looks like this

```typescript
{% include "./demos/button-inline-demo/button-inline-demo.component.ts" %}
```

NgDoc will render its code like below

{{ NgDocActions.demo("ButtonInlineDemoComponent") }}

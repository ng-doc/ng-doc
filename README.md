<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project was originally created to speed up the writing of documentation for your Angular
libraries and applications and make it flexible. We want to make this process as quick and easy as
possible for you so that you can focus on writing code and not on finding solutions for your
documentation.

NgDoc allows you to do the following things:

- Dynamic markdown templates for your guidelines via Nunjucks
- Render demos on the page in one line of code
- Create playgrounds for your Angular Components and Directives
- The documentation for your API is based on comments to your code
- Dynamic links to API, Pages, or foreign websites via `Keywords` feature
- Automatic generation of links to your API in code examples or in mentions of any entity inside
  inline code
- Offline search that collects indexes automatically based on you documentation
- Customizable interface
- And much more!
